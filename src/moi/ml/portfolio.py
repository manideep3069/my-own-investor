"""Portfolio constructor v1: top-N composite scores with sector caps and regime scaling.

Deterministic and constraint-first (no optimizer yet — skfolio mean-variance is a later
refinement). Constraints: max positions, max share of the book per sub-sector,
gross exposure scaled by the regime; the remainder stays in cash.
